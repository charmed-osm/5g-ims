# SCSCF

## Description

Serving CSCF decides whether UEâ€™s sip message should be forwarded to
application servers

Contains Juju action log-level which is used to set log level of SCSCF.

## Prerequisite

a. Install Charmcraft

   ```bash
   sudo snap install charmcraft --beta
   ```

## Usage

SCSCF checks for the authentication data of UE and proceeds to forward the
registration request  or SIP messages to the application servers only if the
authentication data matches with the database.

### Deploy from local repository

   ```bash
   charmcraft build
   juju deploy scscf.charm
   ```

NOTE: SCSCF can be deployed only after Mysql is up because of relations
configured between the two.

## Developing

To test log-level action,run the following command
COMMAND : sudo juju run-action scscf/< UNIT-ID > log-level debugval=3

To check the status and output of the action ,use the following command

COMMAND:
sudo juju show-action-status < ACTION-ID >
sudo juju show-action-output < ACTION-ID >

Create and activate a virtualenv with the development requirements:

   virtualenv -p python3 venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## Testing

The Python operator framework includes a very nice harness for testing
operator behaviour without full deployment. Just `run_tests`:

   ./run_tests
