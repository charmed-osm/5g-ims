# scscf

## Description

Serving CSCF decides whether UEâ€™s sip message should be forwarded to application servers

## Usage

SCSCF checks for the authentication data of UE and proceeds to forward the registration request  or SIP messages to the application servers only if the authentication data matches with the database.

## Developing

Create and activate a virtualenv with the development requirements:

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## Testing

The Python operator framework includes a very nice harness for testing
operator behaviour without full deployment. Just `run_tests`:

    ./run_tests
